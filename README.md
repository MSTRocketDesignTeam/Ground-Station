# Overview

This repository contains the Ground Station Information.

## Purpose and Motivation
The goal of this project is to create a mobile computer and power system for use in the field.

The primary focus for this project is to create a low power replcement for a computer. This would allow us to have easy acces to communitation with the rocket, as well as on the field programming if the need arrises. 

The secondary purpose of this is to have a mobile power source for anything that might require it, and have that power source last for the entirety of a launch day.

## Inspirations

Initial developments of this system is to replace the need for a laptop and power source when out during launches and test fires.
